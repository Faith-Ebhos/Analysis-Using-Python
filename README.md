# 🐍 Exploring Data with Python – A Real-World Analysis Portfolio

Welcome to my **Python-based data exploration project**, where I demonstrate how to derive insights from raw datasets using **Python** and run analyses interactively with **Google Colab**. This project showcases my ability to **clean, analyze, and visualize** data using Python libraries, and communicate insights effectively through code, charts, and narrative.

## 📌 Project Description

This project showcases a complete exploratory data analysis (EDA) workflow using Python. The dataset includes records such as customer details, transactions, and regional sales performance. The goal is to identify trends, outliers, and opportunities using **data wrangling, visualization, and narrative storytelling**.

Key steps covered:
- Data cleaning and handling of missing values
- Descriptive statistics and feature distributions
- Outlier detection
- Visual storytelling through Python plotting libraries
- Collaboration and documentation in **Google Colab**

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python 3.11**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and wrangling
- **NumPy** – Efficient numerical computations
- **Matplotlib** – Line plots, bar charts, and visual summaries
- **Seaborn** – Advanced visualizations like correlation heatmaps and pair plots
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab** – Interactive, cloud-based notebook environment
- **Scikit-learn (optional)** – Preprocessing and ML-ready pipelines
